# Cricket_Ball_Detection
These are the models I trained to detect the cricket ball in multiple frames in a video. This model helped automate the process of annotation of cricket ball in each frame of the video clips which will then be used to train the Faster R-CNN model for 3D Cricket Ball Tracking project.
